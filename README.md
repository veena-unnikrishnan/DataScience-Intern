# Tasks

1. Visualizing the Colorization Process. Description: Visualize the intermediate stages of your model's colorization process to better understand how the image transitions from grayscale to color. Guidelines: Use visual tools to demonstrate how colorization progresses across your model's layers or stages. GUI is not necessary.

2. Dataset Augmentation to Improve Colorization Description: Create a model that leverages augmented datasets to enhance the colorization of grayscale photos. Experiment with various augmentation techniques (such as rotation, flipping, and brightness alteration). Guidelines: This work focuses on improving model performance using data augmentation. After training on supplemented data, the model should improve its colorization outcomes. A GUI is not required, but a comparison of before and after outcomes should be provided

3. Artistic Style Transfer in Colorization Description: In this job, you will create a model that colorizes grayscale photos while simultaneously applying a specific artistic style to the colorized output. Guidelines: This exercise examines your ability to mix image colorization and style transfer approaches. The model should let users select from predetermined artistic styles. A graphical user interface (GUI) is required to allow users to submit photographs and choose styles.

4. Conditional image Colorization Description: Create a model that colorizes grayscale photos based on user-defined circumstances, such as making the sky blue or the grass green. Guidelines: The challenge assesses your ability to incorporate user feedback into the colorization process. The model should allow users to enter or pick color criteria for specific areas of the image. A user interface (GUI) should be implemented to support this interaction.

5. Context Aware Colorisation of Complex Scenes Description: Create a model that can colorize complicated sceneries with various elements, such as cityscapes or forests, based on the scene's contextual information. The model should intelligently select colors based on the relationships between objects (e.g., shadows and reflections). Guidelines: This job necessitates excellent scene comprehension and contextual awareness. The GUI should allow users to submit photographs, and the model should generate high-quality colorized output that takes into account the scene's intricacy and context.

6. Time-Based Historical Image Colorization Description: Create a model that colorizes grayscale photos according to the time period they represent. The model should automatically recognize the image's era (e.g., 1900s, 1950s) and use the proper color palette for that time. Guidelines: The model should be capable of processing a wide range of historical photos and providing correct colorizations based on the observed time period. The GUI should allow users to submit photographs and see the time-based colorized results, with the option to manually alter the era if necessary.

7. Interactive User-Guided Colorization Description: Create a model that allows users to interactively control the colorization process. Users should be able to select specific sections of an image and define the colors they want, which the model will subsequently use to impact the overall colorization of the image. Guidelines: The GUI should allow users to upload photographs, select locations, and set color preferences. The model should dynamically change the colorization based on user input, resulting in a highly personalized colorization experience.



# Instructions:  
 
1. requirement.txt
2. model training file (.ipnby)
3. model weight ( if it's a large file it can be shared on google drive and the link should be paste)
4. saved model ( if a large file , upload that on google drive and give the link)
5. GUI if needed 
6. The files should be upload in github and share github repository to us
7. You must train your own machine learning models—using pre-trained models can also lead to disqualification.
8. Your tasks will be evaluated not only on model accuracy but also on overall performance. Use metrics like confusion matrix, precision, and recall showcasing your model’s effectiveness.
9. The Model should achieve minimum 70% accuracy.
